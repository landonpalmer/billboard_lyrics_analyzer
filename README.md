Billboard Lyrics Analyzer

Howdy! This project was just uploaded to showcase my coding skills for an internship. This project was created
for my Capstone Diploma project which earned the maximum score possible (shoot me an email at landonjpalmer@gmail.com for a copy of my research paper). It came out better than expected, as it features the ability to access any song from the Billboard 100 Year-End Rankings from it's creation in 1951 to the most recent edition as of today (9/4/2019). This was made possible with the scraping library "Jsoup" and lots of "Inspect Element" in Chrome.

The source for the lyrics is a website that permits the replication of content for non-commercial use. However, to avoid automatic black-listing, there are some methods to throw off auto-banning like random request time-intervals and user-agents.

The NLP for lyrics allows for a user to categorize words from these Billboard 100 songs into 3 groups using a highlighting function. While it is very low-level, the NLP is effective in the application. Data for this processing is supplied by Google Search's official list of banned words (~180) as well as some other online resources for affection and drug references (these two were done in a hurry and therefore contained more hardcoding). Check this out by clicking on a song in the table!

Various other features include Excel compatibility for exporting and numerical statistics on lyrics in categorization results.
Also, several methods were created for the research paper's own use and have no functionality with the UI Window (like counting all words for a year broken down by 2 filters). My paper actually includes some interesting data on these historical trends, particularly with obscenity!

This was a very fun project to develop and I would love to hear any suggestions, comments, or feedback!
